      <description>By 4 p.m., Irelys Rojas begins to fear the end of the day.
It’s raining, and most restaurants she performs in are empty. She sits down [where?] to count how much she’s made for that day, [describe her feelings more specifically].
She has $24,000 Colombian pesos, or about $8.
She needed to make $33 that day to afford rent, her metro ticket and a meal for the day. The rest — about $20 — she planned to send to her parents and three teenage boys back in Margarita, an island off the northeastern coast of?</description>

      <description>As resources dwindle, violence erupts, and corruption becomes rampant, Venezuelans cope with the reality of leaving their home. They are forced to leave nearly everything behind in search of a safer life. However, some items are held near and dear as families and individuals escape the turmoil that has overridden their country. Venezuelans hold these items close to their heart while they hope for the day that their country will return to peace.</description>

      <description>Saida Kriz, 55, was only 16 when she left everything she knew behind in Venezuela. She grew up around many types of Venezuelan art and had a passion for it — painting, singing, dancing, designing and making dresses.
Kriz moved to Texas in 1980 following her ex-husband — two years later she moved back to Venezuela. In 1985 she decided to move back to the U.S. for good. She came to North Carolina, where she saw a need for a dance group representing traditional Latin dance, which led her to form The Venezuelan Dance Group in 1987, a non-profit that promotes Venezuelan culture to the next generation in the triangle area.</description>

      <description>“¡Hay que terminar!”
“You have to finish!” Soccer players with Adidas-striped shoulders shout from the sidelines as their teammates complete a four-on-four drill. The next wave of defenders entering the field cause black turf beads to fly through the Medellín night sky. One, wearing all white save for his neon yellow cleats, slides toward the ball, tripping up the offensive player looking for an open man.
“¡Sigue jugando!”
“Keep playing!” The ball travels like a current between the defender’s feet, and he dribbles it to safety.</description>

      <description>After leaving behind their home country, where most Venezuelan immigrants spent their entire lives, families are forced to start over. Migrants find new places to live wherever they can around the city. Some live night to night in different inquilinatos, while others live in rented apartments and others still find one-room homes to buy. In most cases there is not enough room for families to sleep comfortably.
&amp;ldquo;We feel satisfied because we’re sharing with the biggest group of the family, which is the grandkids, and we keep fighting.</description>

      <description>Marbis Judith Verenzuela knew she had to go back. Her second daughter, Jorlis, had been too weak to cross the border the first time the family tried, TKTK when.
Jorlis, 29, had surgery to remove a brain tumor TK WHEN/how close to crossing attempt, but suffered convulsions for 30 days due to side affects and a lack of medicine to control them. Jorlis couldn’t recognize her own children, but had TKTK [need to set up more of the events as they tried to leave].</description>

      <description>After traveling hundreds of miles on foot, a group of five Venezuelans, who together call themselves a family, arrived in Medellin on February 27th. Before leaving their homes, they all held different, honest jobs including food service and hair care but were all laid off over the course of the last year due to a crumbling economy. Now in Colombia, the family works 15 hour days asking for money in exchange for small candies on the street in order to make enough money to afford food and a tiny room to sleep in each night.</description>

      <description>It took four arepas to fill Jeham Carlos Rosa’s stomach back in Venezuela, when he was six years old. But he decided to get by on just two as his parents struggled to keep enough food in the house to feed the family, leaving him feeling hungry. Three years later, Rosa recalls the difficult decisions he made behind his parents back before he and his mother fled to Medellin. His mother, Alejandrina, sits next to him crying as she hears her son’s tender sacrifice for the first time.</description>

      <description>Creating a new life in a new country is no easy feat, especially for the Venezuelan people. Many of these immigrants in Colombia strike an uphill, as their journeys have faced many obstacles in their search to restart or preserve their way of life. This dream of success isn’t impossible, however. These Venezuelans have done just that; whether it be living life without debt for the first time or preserving a family business, these Venezuelans have found a way to survive for their families.</description>

      <description>The sounds of car honks and bicycle bells erupt in the ears of locals and tourists passing through Plaza Botero.
A light breeze fills the air and flows through the skyscraping palm trees of the plaza. It’s cool enough to alleviate the sun’s heat but not cool enough to give one goosebumps.
But in the land of the eternal spring, the weather is often unpredictable.
To the left, some hail taxis and sell warmly colored tropical fruits like pineapples and mangos.</description>

undefined, Medellín is the second largest city in Colombia and one of the most populous areas for Venezuelan immigrants. The metropolitan area provided our team with ample access to Venezuelans without the safety concerns of a border city. Our hope is that the stories we gathered in Colombia will shed a light and inspire positive change for the millions of Venezuelans displaced by the humanitarian crisis in their home country.</description>
