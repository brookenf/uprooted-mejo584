      <description>Saida Kriz, 55, was only 16 when she left everything she knew behind in Venezuela. She grew up around many types of Venezuelan art and had a passion for it — painting, singing, dancing, designing and making dresses.
Kriz moved to Texas in 1980 following her ex-husband — two years later she moved back to Venezuela. In 1985 she decided to move back to the U.S. for good. She came to North Carolina, where she saw a need for a dance group representing traditional Latin dance, which led her to form The Venezuelan Dance Group in 1987, a non-profit that promotes Venezuelan culture to the next generation in the triangle area.</description>
