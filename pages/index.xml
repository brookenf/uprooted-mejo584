      <description>“¡Hay que terminar!”
“You have to finish!” Soccer players with Adidas-striped shoulders shout from the sidelines as their teammates complete a four-on-four drill. The next wave of defenders entering the field cause black turf beads to fly through the Medellín night sky. One, wearing all white save for his neon yellow cleats, slides toward the ball, tripping up the offensive player looking for an open man.
“¡Sigue jugando!”
“Keep playing!” The ball travels like a current between the defender’s feet, and he dribbles it to safety.</description>

      <description>Marbis Judith Verenzuela knew she had to go back. Her second daughter, Jorlis, had been too weak to cross the border the first time the family tried, TKTK when.

      <description>It took four arepas to fill Jeham Carlos Rosa’s stomach back in Venezuela, when he was six years old. But he decided to get by on just two as his parents struggled to keep enough food in the house to feed the family, leaving him feeling hungry. Three years later, Rosa recalls the difficult decisions he made behind his parents back before he and his mother fled to Medellin. His mother, Alejandrina, sits next to him crying as she hears her son’s tender sacrifice for the first time.</description>

      <description>The sounds of car honks and bicycle bells erupt in the ears of locals and tourists passing through Plaza Botero.
A light breeze fills the air and flows through the skyscraping palm trees of the plaza. It’s cool enough to alleviate the sun’s heat but not cool enough to give one goosebumps.
