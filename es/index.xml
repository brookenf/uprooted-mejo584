      <description>“¡Hay que terminar!”
“You have to finish!” Soccer players with Adidas-striped shoulders shout from the sidelines as their teammates complete a four-on-four drill. The next wave of defenders entering the field cause black turf beads to fly through the Medellín night sky. One, wearing all white save for his neon yellow cleats, slides toward the ball, tripping up the offensive player looking for an open man.
“¡Sigue jugando!”
“Keep playing!” The ball travels like a current between the defender’s feet, and he dribbles it to safety.</description>

      <description>Marbis Judith Verenzuela knew she had to go back. Her second daughter, Jorlis, had been too weak to cross the border the first time the family tried, TKTK when.
Jorlis, 29, had surgery to remove a brain tumor TK WHEN/how close to crossing attempt, but suffered convulsions for 30 days due to side affects and a lack of medicine to control them. Jorlis couldn’t recognize her own children, but had TKTK [need to set up more of the events as they tried to leave].</description>

      <description>It took four arepas to fill Jeham Carlos Rosa’s stomach back in Venezuela, when he was six years old. But he decided to get by on just two as his parents struggled to keep enough food in the house to feed the family, leaving him feeling hungry. Three years later, Rosa recalls the difficult decisions he made behind his parents back before he and his mother fled to Medellin. His mother, Alejandrina, sits next to him crying as she hears her son’s tender sacrifice for the first time.</description>

      <description>As resources dwindle, violence erupts, and corruption becomes rampant, Venezuelans cope with the reality of leaving their home. They are forced to leave nearly everything behind in search of a safer life. However, some items are held near and dear as families and individuals escape the turmoil that has overridden their country. Venezuelans hold these items close to their heart while they hope for the day that their country will return to peace.</description>
