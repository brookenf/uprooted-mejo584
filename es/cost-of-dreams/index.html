  <p>It took four arepas to fill Jeham Carlos Rosa’s stomach back in Venezuela, when he was six years old. But he decided to get by on just two as his parents struggled to keep enough food in the house to feed the family, leaving him feeling hungry. Three years later, Rosa recalls the difficult decisions he made behind his parents back before he and his mother fled to Medellin. His mother, Alejandrina, sits next to him crying as she hears her son’s tender sacrifice for the first time.</p>

<p>The pair moved to Colombia temporarily in October 2018, along with his grandmother and a family friend. He sits with his mother on the only bed in their tiny one-bedroom rental that is thinner than a pillow and feels as hard as a brick. Jeham is thin and short for a 9-year-old boy, with a charismatic smile and a tenacious old soul.</p>

<p>But even though Jeham has more food in Medellin, it comes at a price. Instead of going to school, he sells “confetti” or candy, in Parque Berrio, a park known for drugs, gangs, and prostitution in order to feed himself and his family. Rosa says he did not leave Venezuela intending to work, for him it was an exciting adventure. However, when he arrived in Colombia, there was a different reality.</p>

<div id="video-top"></div>

<!-- Children and education video goes here -->

<div class="video-container flex">
  <iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/265319522" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
 </div>

<p>The Medellin Education System says every migrant children who seeks education is given the opportunity however; Like Jeham, there are many Venezuelan youth not attending school or at risk of losing their access to education in Colombia because they fear deportation, not having enough resources, or not affording daily food and transportation costs. According to The International Rescue Committee, roughly 50 percent of Venezuelan Kids in Colombia are not enrolled in school.</p>

<p>Alejandrina started selling coffee in Parque Berrio. Dressed in soccer jerseys, Jeham  would accompany her as she struggled to make enough money.
After TK how long, to start selling candy in the park.</p>

<p>Alejandrina says she was apprehensive at first. “It was hard in the beginning &hellip;. as a mother, I felt bad,” she said. “ I used to say ‘God, he is just a kid and doesn’t deserve this type of life.’ Now, I feel proud because I see how much strength he shows.”</p>

<p>At only 9, Jeham now makes most of the income for his family; however; he has been saving money to reward his inner child. His perseverance and dedication helped him buy a game boy and toys that he plans to take back for his cousins.</p>

<div class="story__subhead flex-column">Education in Venezuela</div>

<p>Jeham attended a private school in back in Venezuela, wherewhile Alejandrina was the principle. As the economic crisis grew, their home was destroyed. “Above everything, it affected my family,” Alejandrina says. “Maybe because we didn’t know how to handle it.” She was forced to find a second job as a teacher in a public school, but had to move to a new town and and pledge loyalty to Hugo Chavez, the TKTK role.</p>

<p>Rosa’s education was also affected when he had no other option but to attend a public school. He said the experience at the public school was so much harder because he says his classmates weren’t able to afford anything. “I felt really bad, sometimes they [his friends] brought a banana and that was what they ate the whole day,” said Rosa. His mom agrees.</p>

<p>Alejandrina is currently on maternity leave, due with her second child in June. She wishes not to use her last name because if the government found out she left Venezuela, she would be fired. Fearing the possibility of losing her job, the pair left without anyone knowing or getting their passport stamped. With the hopes of returning to her home country, she did not file for any permit, help, or education for the family.</p>

<p>Alejandrina immigrated to Colombia [when] hoping to make enough money to cover the supplies for the birth. She says pregnant women are expected to bring materials that doctors use during the surgery. “There is no birth citizen right in Colombia,” she says. “So giving birth here was not a possibility.”</p>

<p>Alejandrina says she saw both the public and private schools suffer from the crisis. She says the kids she oversaw in the private school had everything in regards to food, school supplies, shoes, but were affected psychologically. “A lot of them cry in the classrooms because they miss their parents who left them to give them the life they have,” says Alejandrina.</p>

<p>But Alejandrina says the kids she teaches in the public school are even more affected. “When we came back from summer, the kids were skinnier and unrecognizable,” she says. They had no school supplies, shoes, nutritional and psychological effects. Alejandra had to accept kids as young as fourth grade arriving late because they were taking care of their younger siblings.</p>

<p>Lisbeth Marcana was a teacher in Venezuela for 25 years before she arrived to Medellin in May 2018. She says children are the most affected during the crisis. “It’s hard to see a child faint during the national anthem because he has not eaten,” Marcana says. Most kids would save their only meal for dinner or have the water that was left over while cooking with salt for breakfast and lunch.</p>

<p>“They have a strong level of malnutrition, that there growth and cognitive development is not the same,” says Marcana. “Instead of thinking about math, they’re thinking about food.”</p>

<p>She says that although President Nicolas Maduro created a program called PAE (School Food Program,) it is not enough. The food arrives every eight days and most of the fruit is damaged. Not only that but Marcana says the food was only enough for 200 children at the school of 1000 students. The school was forced to prioritize the students who spent the most time there and then then what was left over was for the youngest students.</p>

<p>During her years of teaching in Venezuela the curriculum changed. Marcana says in 1996 they used to work with pedagogical classroom projects until 2006 when it was changed into the Bolivarian curriculum. “They removed some of the most important content,” says Marcana. “They focused more on the social and political education.” Instead of focusing on teaching spanish she said she would have to teach her children about socialist “heroes” like Ezequiel Zamora.</p>

<p>The government also changed the standards for how children were held back in schools. In the new system the teacher first has to have permission of the parents and then permission of the government. “It’s too much money that teacher do not have. As a result every student passes,” says Marcana. As a teacher she recognized how students mentality was influenced by the government. The kids would constantly ask her why they weren’t equal to everyone if they lived in a socialistic society. “He brought two colors to class, I’m going to take one away from him because we are equal and so he has to have one and I have to have one,” her kids would say.</p>

<p>Although Marcana says she really wanted to help her students, the money she made was not enough. Every two weeks she would receive a paycheck of 18,000 bolivares which was enough for half a kilogram of cheese. She too recalls student fainting during the anthem, classes, or at anytime. All the teachers would come together and talk about who could help this student by pitching food for the student.</p>

<p>Today, Marcana works cleaning houses because she wasn’t able to validate her teaching degree. In her free time she helps Venezuelan children immigrating to Medellin who are not adapting to their new schools.  “Their lives are completely changed,” Marcana said.</p>

<p>(Trying to find a stat about how many venezuelan children are in Colombia to put right here.)</p>

<p>Anyelis and her brother are apart of those (number of children) who are in Colombia and wake up everyday with uncertainty of when it will be the last day they are able to attend school. The pair walks approximately 20 minutes to school through what they call a shortcut. They live in a community that’s high up a mountain and on their way to school the view of the city is priceless. They walk through a small bridge and trees as they say hi to their friends along the way.</p>

<p>Something as simple as school books can have a great effect on children. In Venezuela children have three school books but when they arrive to Medellin they have nine. Children are also used to having mainly women as teachers but when in Medellin it’s common to have male as teachers as well as females. “Then that rhythm of life hits them, because it changes their life completely,” Marcana said. The differences between the same language in two different countries really affects the child. It’s shocks them and they think the teacher is being rude or can’t understand them,” says Marcana.</p>

<p>Anyelis and Anyelo both say they have been welcomed by their peers and adapted well into the education system. But getting there was not as easy. Education has always been one of Anyelis’ passion and she took upon herself to make it happen in Medellin. One day Anyelis woke up determined to enroll in school. She got dressed and walked to the nearest school and explained her situation to her current principal. “Anyelis was the one that moved around to get us the spot for the school,” said Anyelos. “She did a lot of stuff so we could study and if it wasn’t for her we wouldn’t be studying in this moment.”</p>

<p>Because of their lack of paperwork the pair says they lost a year of school when they first arrived to Medellin, following their mom. Anyelis says she was not allowed to attend until her uncle moved to Medellin from Venezuela and brought their paperwork with him. During that year Anyelis and her brother helped their mom by selling food in different areas. As the sales went down they couldn’t afford to keep selling and the frustration of not attending school was getting higher, especially for Anyelis.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education in Medellin says their Mayor Federico Gutierrez has opened the door for every migrant child to have access to education. They believe education is the best strategy of security to keep children away from drugs, gangs and all the problems that come with vulnerable children. “The education right is a fundamental right that is not bounded to any migratory status,” says Viviana Palacio Revello of communications.  “The Medellin Education System has been opened to the Venezuelan immigrant kids despite the immigration status they have.”</p>

<p>“I wanted to study, and many times I’d go and find out things while my mom was working,” says Anyelis. “The principal sent me to the educative nucleus were I was give a validation package to complete.” The Ministry of Education says a migrant child does not need any paperwork in order to attend school.</p>
