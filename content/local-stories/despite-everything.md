<p class="drop-cap">Saida Kriz, 55, was only 16 when she left everything she knew behind in Venezuela. She grew up around many types of Venezuelan art and had a passion for it — painting, singing, dancing, designing and making dresses.</p>

Kriz moved to Texas in 1980 following her ex-husband — two years later she moved back to Venezuela. In 1985 she decided to move back to the U.S. for good. She came to North Carolina, where she saw a need for a dance group representing traditional Latin dance, which led her to form The Venezuelan Dance Group in 1987, a non-profit that promotes Venezuelan culture to the next generation in the triangle area.

Kriz now has managed, choreographed, designed and hand-made the group’s costumes and props for more than 30 years. “Every Venezuelan loves to dance,” said Kriz. “If a drum starts playing while a Venezuelan is sitting down, he’s dancing in his chair.”

The music lights up the garage that’s turned into a studio. The walls are covered with Venezuelan handmade paintings, masks, costumes and a mirror as she shows her dance members how to wave their long colorful traditional skirts.

One of those members is Sandra Lopenza, 53; she has danced with the group for 15 years. Lopenza’s daughter, Rosana, is already a member of the group. “She’s an amazing leader who is tolerant, patient and considerate,” said Lopenza. “But above everything else, she’s an amazing person.” She marveled at Kriz’s ability to keep her Venezuelan roots close no matter how long she has been in the U.S.

Kriz says she dedicates all of her time trying to keep the dance group together and running successfully. Even though she doesn’t get paid, she is receiving something else in exchange — love. “We’ve seen people cry because [the dance] reminds them of when they used to be in Venezuela,” said Kriz. “They tell us, ‘thank you for bringing this dance to us, it’s wonderful.’”

Many Venezuelans are running from a political and economic crisis in their country. The Venezuelan community in the U.S. is one of the fastest growing. It placed number one on the list of U.S. affirmative asylum requests in 2017, above China. Last year their applications hit more than 13,500.

Kriz arrived before the current exodus of migrants. She and the group seek to be the connection between America, immigrants and Venezuela. “I feel a sense of pride to show people here how beautiful Venezuela is despite everything going on,” said Kriz.

Paty Capote, 43, invited the group to dance at a gala she organized to raise money for Venezuelan migrants in Colombia. She was very touched by their passion and performance. “It was beautiful. I was almost in tears. There’s always a part of your heart that stays in your country,” said Capote. “I know they were dancing with their heart and that was very moving to me.”
