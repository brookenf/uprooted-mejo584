After leaving behind their home country, where most Venezuelan immigrants spent their entire lives, families are forced to start over. Migrants find new places to live wherever they can around the city. Some live night to night in different <em>inquilinatos</em>, while others live in rented apartments and others still find one-room homes to buy. In most cases there is not enough room for families to sleep comfortably.

Living in a tiny room, the friends spend the night in places known as <em>inquilinato</em>, small rooms that can be rented out daily. For about $10 USD, the friends have a place to lay their heads at night. Most rooms offer only a small bed, a dresser and a TV. Hundreds of Venezuelans who have made their way to Colombia find themselves living in such places because they have little money to rent out proper homes.
