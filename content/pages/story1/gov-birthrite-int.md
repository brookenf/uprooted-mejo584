            <div class="interactive__intro">Birthright citizenship is the common term to refer to jus soli, meaning “right of the soil” — the right of anyone born in the territory of a state to nationality or citizenship.<br><br>

            While United States grants unconditional citizenship by birth, most countries use a system of “citizenship by blood” — meaning that a person born in that country would only be considered as a citizen if one (or both) of their parents has citizenship.</div>

                <p>Colombia has what we could call as “conditional” birthright citizenship. To obtain the Colombian citizenship at birth, one must have at least one parent a Colombian citizen or a Colombian legal resident.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, many Venezuelan migrants do not fit into this description.</p>

                <p>In order to get citizenship for a baby born in Colombia by Venezuelan parents, one of the parents has to have residency documentation, or the special stay permit known as PEP.</p>
                <p>Many Venezuelans have missed the PEP applications and stayed in other forms of documentation, and their new born babies become stateless.</p>
