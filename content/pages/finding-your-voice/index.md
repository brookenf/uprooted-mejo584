By 4 p.m., Irelys Rojas begins to fear the end of the day.

It’s raining, and most restaurants she performs in are empty. She  sits down [where?] to count how much she’s made for that day, [describe her feelings more specifically].

She has $24,000 Colombian pesos, or about $8.

She needed to make $33 that day to afford rent, her metro ticket and a meal for the day. The rest — about $20 —  she planned to send to her parents and three teenage boys back in Margarita, an island off the  northeastern coast of? Venezuela. That $20 could buy them carton of eggs and a liter of milk.

For spends therest of the evening walking the streets of downtown Medellín, hiding her tears between smiles as she loudly greets every vendor on the block selling candy, phone cards, fake jewelry.

She’s only known them since January, when she began to sing in restaurants shortly after arriving in Medellin, Colombia. The TKTK DESCRIBE HER, TK AGE, drags a speaker on wheels behind her as she SINGS TKTK WHAT in TKTK WHAT KINDS OF PLACES.  Colombia. Many of the vendors  also crossed the border without a passport, shutting down the chance of obtaining a work permit in the neighboring country. What did she do back home? Let’s tease out some more details so we care more about her early in the story

“We’re just waiting for the page to open so we can get a permit,” she said. “Who’s going to want to leave Venezuela without a passport?”  

Migración Colombia estimates that <a href="#">more than a million Venezuelans have moved to Colombia</a>, and about half remain undocumented, either because they crossed the border illegally, overstayed the stamp in their passports, or didn’t leave Colombia after entering with a Border Mobility Card, an ID provided to residents of border state to move freely along the frontier.

 --Back story / what she’s gone through-- [I want to make this section about how illegal street vendors are a thing in Colombia anyway, but now there’s competition / can the cops deport Venezuelans for selling candy on the street, what does the law says, etc?]

All she needed to do was sell her house. When a man offered Irelys $200 for the *description* apartment, she took them without hesitation — it was enough to buy smartphone to keep in touch with her kids, and keep some cash for the trip.

In just four days, she hitchhiked her way into Colombia with only $50 in her pocket, which she paid to a guard in La Guajira to cross through a family home.

When she saw the abundance of food just a few yards from the border, she felt shame.
There was bread, buñuelos, pan de bono, pastelitos, empanadas, and she could afford them.

Even with her stomach was growling in pain, she chose not to eat that day. Had her children eaten?

She cried herself to sleep on the bus until 9 p.m. when she finally gave in

She started singing in January after La Paisa, a Colombian woman who controls the informal cookie selling business in Plaza Botero, ratted Irelys out to the cops and they seized her merchandise. The policemen let her go eventually, threatening her with jail/deportationTK if she continued.

Before turning on the speaker in front of the diners, she asks for permission. If granted, she signs a song, and before collecting the tips her livelihood depends on, Irelys reminds the audience, “Good Venezuelans outnumber the bad ones.”
