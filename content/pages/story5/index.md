<p class="drop-cap">The sounds of car honks and bicycle bells erupt in the ears of locals and tourists passing through Plaza Botero.</p>

A light breeze fills the air and flows through the skyscraping palm trees of the plaza. It’s cool enough to alleviate the sun’s heat but not cool enough to give one goosebumps. 

But in the land of the eternal spring, the weather is often unpredictable. 

To the left, some hail taxis and sell warmly colored tropical fruits like pineapples and mangos. To the right, many walk toward Plazuela Comercial Gutenberg, a strip mall that leads to the shops and restaurants of Carabobo #51-62. In the middle, a number of tourists walk under the elevated metro track that lines some of Medellín, Colombia’s vivid green hills and brightly colored homes.

Fernando Botero’s statues line each side of the plaza’s entry, creating a catwalk that leads to the plaza’s focal point, Museo de Antioquia, a local art museum.

Fernando Botero is a Colombian figurative artist and sculptor who is known for his signature style, “Boterismo.” This style includes Botero depicting his statues in a large or exaggerated form, making their features, like the eyes and mouth appear small.

Behind a Botero statue of a woman lying nude on a pedestal is a stoop that lines the Museo de Antioquia.

On this stoop sits another side of the plaza. This side of the plaza remains discrete yet known to the number of men that line it in the late afternoon. This side of the plaza is known well by some Venezuelan women who wish they didn't yet don’t have a choice. 

“There are people who think that if you do this, it’s because you like it or you feel good,” said Maria, who asked that her real name not be used. “I do not know other women but in my case, I don’t feel good and I don’t like it at all.”

Dressed in jean shorts and a camouflage green cold shoulder top, she sits on this stoop every day. She waits in the late afternoon and late into the night for men to ask for “un rato” or a moment. 

Maria, 24, is a sex worker. The single mother from Venezuela is living in Medellin without legal permission, and has few other options for supporting herself.

As Venezuela faces a severe political and economic crisis under President Nicolas Maduro, multiple South American countries have experienced an influx of Venezuelan migrants. Colombia seen the largest influx in the last year, according to a report by the International Organization for Migration. 

Of the 1,032,016 Venezuelans that migrated to Colombia in 2018, <a href="#">more than 50 percent were women</a>, according to the Caracas Chronicles, a news and analysis organization in Venezuela. 

Maria’s father, WHAT KIND OF JOB DID HE HAVE?, helped support her and her two daughters before the economic crisis hit. But, he had to stop because he no longer had enough money to continue doing so. 

“I had to beg my neighbors for food and my children cried and begged for food because they were so hungry,” said Maria. She decided TKTK set up her leaving more. How did she feel about that decision?

“I came to make a living and a better life for my children.”

She told her daughters, ages three and five, that she was going to work far away, but would still contact them.

Minutes before her departure on a heart-wrenching day last December, Maria’s family tried to distract her youngest daughter with milk and cookies as she slipped out. The 5-year-old, however, was well-aware she was leaving. 

“Mom, don’t go,” she screamed, tears running down her brown cheeks. “Mom, I want to go with you!” She frantically banged on the window as Maria [walked out the door?]

“I wonder if my children will miss or remember me,” said Maria.

But the hardships don’t stop once the border is crossed. Aside from learning a new country's customs and searching for work and housing, societal inequalities follow women throughout the migration process. 

For women, the inequalities of a machismo society or aggressive masculine pride follow them. These inequalities include unequal salaries, discrimination, harassment, gender violence and a lack of access to sexual and reproductive rights.

The potential of xenophobia and a situation of vulnerability is also increased for female migrants.

Specifically, as the number of Venezuelan sex workers in Colombia increases, so does the animosity they feel from Colombian sex workers. 

Venezuelan sex workers are more likely to offer their services for as low as 40,000 pesos ($12), three times less than what a Colombian sex worker charges said Adriaan Alsema, founder of Colombia Reports. In the eyes of Colombian sex workers, such low prices are killing their business.

“Colombian women are very mean to Venezuelan women,” said Maria. “I don’t talk to them and just make my money.”

In Maria’s eyes, this job is for her daughters. In Maria’s heart, it’s a sacrifice that brings her to tears and a feeling of disgust that can’t be washed away. No matter how many showers she takes. 

But these are tears and feelings she is willing to endure if it means reuniting with her children. 

Female Venezuelan migrants typically face difficulty finding a stable, well-paying job. This leads them to resort to sex work. 

Over 35 percent of individuals involved in Colombia’s sex trade are Venezuelan, according to Colombia Reports. 

“After working with these women, I noticed many weren’t sex workers before,” said Melissa Toro, director of Las Guerreras del Centro, an organization in Medellín that works to empower and resignify sex work and sex workers. “Here, we have a very high level of unemployment that is difficult for undocumented immigrants.”

After arriving in Medellín, Maria started selling candy on the street for money. She made enough to pay her 10,000 pesos of a room she rents for 30,000 pesos per night. However, Maria would still go hungry for days and wondering if her daughters were doing the same. 

One month passed and Maria was not making much progress with bringing her children to Medellín. 

But an encounter with a Venezuelan man made her realize that she had another choice. A choice that could quickly earn her more money but at a much higher cost. 

“You could make more money selling yourself like other women in Plaza Botero,” he told her. 

Days later, she was in a hotel room with an unknown Venezuelan man. It was Maria’s first of many “ratos.”  

With a stranger on top of her, her back lays flat on the bed. With his weight being felt on her body, Maria’s eyes focus on the ceiling. Physically, she is there but mentally, she is not. Her body is numb and her mind is racing with one thought. 

“When will it end?”

What is only supposed to be 25 minutes feels like a lifetime of discomfort. 

The end is nearing and his weight slowly lifts off of her body. In contrast, a larger emotional and mental weight falls on her. 

He exits the room, leaving his payment on the table and Maria like a used up product. The hotel room door shuts and Maria’s stomach fills with acid, giving her nausea. Her honey brown skin feels soiled with his touch and it is not long before this disgust consumes her internally.

Certain that she can wash him off, Maria runs home to take a shower. 

For Maria, home in Medellín is a flophouse. A rooming house where she rents one small humid bedroom that she shares with two others. Faintly lit by one lightbulb in the ceiling, a bed inside a dark wooden box spring and a thin mattress pad beside it cover three quarters of the room’s red clay tiled floor. The white walls are dingy and the narrow, chocolate-brown door is closed but the boisterous noise that comes through leaves no room for privacy.  

Maria stands under the warm, steaming water for several minutes. Her effort to feel clean again fails.

She steps out of the shower and stares at the money left by the stranger. Her mindset changes and her motivation for her actions comes to surface.  

“I cried and I thought about my girls and whether or not they were eating,” said Maria. “My hope is to bring the girls here so I can leave this life.”

Little by little, Maria continues to get used to “this life.”
