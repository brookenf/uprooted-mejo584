By 4 p.m., Irelys Rojas begins to fear the end of the day.

It’s raining, and the restaurants she performs in are empty. At 5, she sits down at a café to count how much she’s made for the day.

It’s $24,000 Colombian pesos, or about $8.

She needed $33 to afford rent, a bus ride and the single meal she eats per day. The rest — about $20 —  she planned to send to her parents and the three sons she left behind in Margarita Island off the coast of Venezuela.  Despite the soaring inflation at home, it would’ve been enough for a carton of eggs and a liter of milk.

Her charisma shows as Irelys walks the streets of downtown Medellín hiding tears behind smiles as she loudly greets every vendor on the block selling candy, phone cards, fake jewelry.

“Hola, mi amor, ¿Cómo estás?” Hi love, how are you? she tells everyone.

She met them in January, when she began singing in restaurants for tips shortly after arriving. The 38-year-old drags a speaker on wheels, stopping at every coffee shop and eatery that will allow her to perform a song.

In Venezuela, Irelys worked from home designing beach totes and cakes for special occasions. She spent her free time with her boys — Reynaldo, Luis Manuel and Angel Rafael. With inflation reaching 80,000 percent in 2018, there wasn’t much money left for handbags and cake. Less money meant fewer buyers, which meant fewer sales.

Irelys had never traveled outside of the country and therefore never needed a passport. When it was time to leave Venezuela five months ago, she couldn’t afford one.

Getting a passport is a costly, bureaucratic and lengthy endeavor for Venezuelans, but immigrants still yearn for the burgundy booklet and entrance stamp. Hyperinflation and mismanagement left the government unable to issue passports, sometimes lacking the material to make them or the electricity to load citizens’ information on the computer system.

“You have to find a middleman to get an appointment to have your picture taken and then wait months and months for them to tell you there’s no material,” she said.  “Oh, and then pay the middleman like $1,000.”

Crossing the border illegally, she forfeited the chance to have a formal job, access to health care or even a own credit card in Colombia. She is one of half a million Venezuelans who are now in Colombia without proper papers to work or obtain services — a leap of faith taken to escape the unbearable situation in their country.

Renouncing one of her rights — to belong to a country — wasn’t a difficult choice. Her sons need food and notebooks and socks. [what?]

“I’m here because I have to,” she said. “I have three mouths to feed back home in Venezuela, but no one wants to leave their country”

“The border that divides Colombia and Venezuela is the longest and busiest in Latin America, with 70.000 people crossing every day, according to Christian Krüger Sarmiento, the director of Migración Colombia. At least 5 percent, he said, cross to stay.


In an attempt to provide a legal avenue for Venezuelans who cross on a regular basis to find food, medicine and sometimes gasoline, the Colombian government began issuing the Tarjeta de Movilidad Fronteriza, a border mobility card. Venezuelans who reside ion border states can get  a card and move freely across the frontier without a passport.

The six legal border crossings, however, have been closed since late February, following orders from Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, leaving the sea of Venezuelans who cross every day to do so illegally.

In response, the National Colombian Police implemented tougher regulations on the illegal paths known as trochas, establishing checkpoints to verify IDs and criminal records of those making the trip, said Police Col. José Luis Palomino.

From 2016 to 2018, Colombian authorities deported 4,274 Venezuelans, compared to only 294 in the three previous years combined. Many have made headlines for committing gruesome crimes.

Colombia — a country that has historically exported more migrants than it’s taken in — is responding to the mass influx of Venezuelans by granting them legal status under specific conditions. 

Along with border mobility cards, Migración Colombia began issuing a special stay permit in 2017 for Venezuelans, which is valid for two years. Since then, the government has issued various batches for people who entered the country with a stamped passport before a certain date.

With the scarcity of Venezuelan passports, the agency said, as of August, only TKTK has been able to issue the permit known as PEP, the acronym for its name in Spanish.

Another effort to regularize those without a passport was a census, which took place from April to July in 2018. At first, Colombian authorities marketed the census as an effort to count how many Venezuelans remained undocumented in Colombian territory. The registry didn’t promise  legal status but stipulated the information obtained couldn’t be used by authorities for deportation proceedings.

When the census ended, 442,262 Venezuelans who registered online qualified for the PEP, allowing them to obtain legal employment, access the public healthcare system and apply for visas that would grant more permanent legal status.

“That’s a topic that helps us shield the country when it comes to safety but also helps us protect the migrants’ rights, which are oftentimes violated for their condition of irregularity — they’re exploited in the workplace,” Krüger Sarmiento said.  

Still, the government estimates that of the 1.1 million Venezuelans in Colombia, nearly 700,000, or 60 percent, remain undocumented, as of TKTK.

As the first two years of PEPs runs out in JulyTK, it’s unclear whether the government will allow Venezuelans to renew their permits.

“The logic behind it was to allow the two-year time period for Venezuelans to seek a visa — a student visa, a work visa, a refugee visa,” said Carlos Vázquez, the president of ColVenz, a nonprofit in Medellín dedicated to helping new Venezuelan`immigrants. “Some visas take time, some money, some require sponsorship, and some people don’t even know about them. Some people can’t afford to plan that far in advance.”

When Irelys planned her departure, she didn’t even try to get a passport.

Had it been a regular situation where she’d pay a modest fee for her document, she would’ve done it, she said, but spending hundreds of dollars for a document instead of her children’s wellbeing seemed ridiculous.

“I don’t have that kind of money,” she said. “It was never an option for me.”

To leave, all she needed to do was sell her house in Margarita Island.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates at least 3 million Venezuelans have migrated. That’s about 10 percent of the country’s population. In the past years, real estate property values plummeted in a market overwhelmed by soon-to-be immigrants who hope to sell and leave with some money in their pockets.

When a man offered Irelys $200— less than half of what it’s worth —to buy her five-bedroom home, she took it without hesitation — it was enough to get a smartphone to stay in touch with her kids and save some cash for the trip ahead.

In just four days, she hitchhiked 800 miles into Colombia and handed $7 to an indigenous man who allowed a group of Venezuelans to cross through a private house in La Guajira.

Once in Maicao, the first Colombian city she set foot on, Irelys felt overwhelmed. Food was abundant and cheap and people weren’t rummaging through the trash to quiet their stomachs.

There was freshly baked bread, buñuelos, pan de bono, pastelitos, empanadas — all traditional finger food that had become scarce and expensive over the last few years in Venezuela.

Before turning on the speaker in front of the diners, she asks for permission. If granted, she signs a song, and before collecting the tips her livelihood depends on, Irelys reminds the audience, “Good Venezuelans outnumber the bad ones.”
