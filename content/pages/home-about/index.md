Medell√≠n is the second largest city in Colombia and one of the most populous areas for Venezuelan immigrants. The metropolitan area provided our team with ample access to Venezuelans without the safety concerns of a border city. Our hope is that the stories we gathered in Colombia will shed a light and inspire positive change for the millions of Venezuelans displaced by the humanitarian crisis in their home country.
