Creating a new life in a new country is no easy feat, especially for the Venezuelan people. Many of these immigrants in Colombia strike an uphill, as their journeys have faced many obstacles in their search to restart or preserve their way of life. This dream of success isn’t impossible, however. These Venezuelans have done just that; whether it be living life without debt for the first time or preserving a family business, these Venezuelans have found a way to survive for their families.

In Venezuela, Linelvi and her husband had a fairly well off life, even as the Venezuelan crisis began. But once she gave birth to her first-born child, she and her husband decided to move to Medellín because they knew they couldn’t raise him in the chaos of the crisis. Initially, they didn’t consider going to Colombia; they wanted to go to Mexico. But traveling to Mexico was too expensive for them to travel all together. Then, they decided to go to Medellín, because her husband knew someone in the city. This didn’t work out well, however; the husband’s acquaintance stole from them and kicked them out of their residence. Eventually, the two found their place in the Boyacá Mall, after the managers of the mall saw the strong work ethic of Linelvi’s husband, and decided to give them the shop on the agreement of paying their rent on a daily commission instead of monthly. After a year and a half of moving from Venezuela to Colombia, Linelvi and her husband are out of debt for the first time.

Raúl was one of the top olympic shooters in Venezuela, and is now one of the top olympic rifle shooters in all of Colombia. He’s competed everywhere from Germany to Georgia. He decided to move over to Medellín because of his one year old daughter; he and his wife couldn’t get the correct vaccines for her and decided that they couldn’t raise a child in those conditions. Additionally, his wife is Colombian and his father, a former shooter for Venezuela, was recruited by the Colombian national team to coach their rifle shooters; however, he still needs the necessary paperwork to become a Colombian national citizen, or else he cannot compete for the Colombian national team. Although he has pride in being a Venezuelan, and still wears his Venezuelan shooting jersey underneath his current jerseys, he plans on staying in Colombia for the long-term.

Pereira attended school in the U.S. at Washington College in Maryland to play baseball and graduated with a degree in business. His family owned three successful restaurant chains, headed by his father; however, when things started to take a turn, he made the decision to move wife and children to Medellín before things started to look desperate in Venezuela because he feared for the safety of him and his family. In a little over 3 years that he has been in Venezuela, Pereira opened up an Italian restaurant chain, Della Nonna Trattoria structured in a similar process as the restaurant chains that his father opened in Venezuela, in 3 different locations in the city of Medellín.
